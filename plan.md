- Session timeout and refresh mechanisms

### 🗄️ Database Architecture Overhaul

#### Migration to PostgreSQL
```sql
-- Enhanced User table with proper constraints
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(120) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role user_role_enum NOT NULL,
    company_name VARCHAR(100),
    address TEXT,

    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    failed_login_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    locked_until TIMESTAMP NULL
);

-- Add proper indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users(role);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_batch_id ON products(batch_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_manufacturer ON products(manufacturer_id);
```

#### Improved Models with Relationships
```python
class Product(db.Model):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Proper relationships
    manufacturer = db.relationship('User', foreign_keys=[manufacturer_id], backref='manufactured_products')
    distributor = db.relationship('User', foreign_keys=[distributor_id], backref='distributed_products')
    
    # Audit fields
    created_by = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    updated_by = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    version = db.Column(db.Integer, default=1)
    
    # Soft delete
    deleted_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
    is_deleted = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
```

            <ProductList products={products} />
            <ProductForm onSubmit={handleAddProduct} />
        </div>
    );

# MediLedger Project Review and Improvement Plan

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the MediLedger project and outlines a strategic roadmap for its improvement.

## 1. Summary of Current Architecture

The MediLedger project is a web-based application designed to track and monitor medicine quality using a private blockchain. It was initially developed as a submission for a hackathon. The current architecture consists of the following components:

-   **Backend:** A monolithic Flask application (`app.py`) that handles all business logic, including user authentication, role-based access control (Manufacturer, Distributor, Pharmacy), and data management.
-   **Database:** A single SQLite database file (`medical_tracking.db`) managed by Flask-SQLAlchemy. The database stores information about users, products, transport tracking, and pharmacy inventory.
-   **Blockchain:** A custom-built, proof-of-work blockchain implemented in Python (`blockchain.py`). It is exposed via a separate Flask-based REST API server (`blockchain_server.py`) that communicates with the main application.
-   **Frontend:** A set of server-rendered HTML templates (`/templates`) using Jinja2 and styled with Tailwind CSS loaded via a CDN. The frontend includes dashboards for different user roles and a public-facing page for consumers to track products.
-   **AI/ML:** The `README.md` mentions AI-powered features for quality monitoring and predictive analytics, but there is no actual implementation of these features in the codebase.

## 2. Identified Issues or Limitations

While the project serves as a good proof-of-concept, it has several limitations that hinder its viability as a production-ready system:

-   **Monolithic Backend:** The `app.py` file contains all the application's logic, making it difficult to maintain, test, and scale. The code is tightly coupled, and there is no clear separation of concerns.
-   **Insecure and Inefficient Blockchain:**
    -   The proof-of-work consensus mechanism is run by a single, centralized server, which defeats the purpose of a decentralized ledger.
    -   A new block is mined for every single transaction, which is highly inefficient and not scalable.
    -   The blockchain is not persistent and resets every time the server restarts.
-   **Unsuitable Database:**
    -   SQLite is not suitable for a multi-user, production environment that requires concurrent write access.
    -   The database schema lacks proper foreign key constraints and relationships, leading to potential data integrity issues.
-   **Frontend and UI/UX Concerns:**
    -   The frontend is not modular and relies on CDN-loaded libraries, which can be a security risk and lead to performance issues.
    -   There is no CSRF protection on forms, making the application vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.
    -   The user interface is not built with a modern, component-based framework, which makes it hard to manage and extend.
-   **Missing AI/ML Capabilities:** The project claims to have AI features, but no such models are implemented. The "alerts" are simple, rule-based checks, not predictive analytics.
-   **Lack of Automated Testing:** The absence of a test suite (unit, integration, or end-to-end) makes it risky to introduce changes or refactor the codebase.

## 3. Recommended Improvements

To address the identified limitations, I recommend the following improvements:

-   **Backend Refactoring:**
    -   Re-architect the Flask application using **Blueprints** to create a modular, service-oriented structure.
    -   Separate business logic from the view functions to improve maintainability.
-   **Blockchain Enhancement:**
    -   Replace the custom proof-of-work blockchain with a more appropriate solution. Options include:
        1.  **Adopting a permissioned blockchain framework** like Hyperledger Fabric or a simpler Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism if a custom solution is preferred.
        2.  **Using a managed blockchain service** to reduce operational overhead.
-   **Database Upgrade and Redesign:**
    -   Migrate from SQLite to a more robust, production-grade database like **PostgreSQL**.
    -   Redesign the database schema to enforce referential integrity with proper foreign key relationships and indexing for better performance.
-   **Frontend Modernization:**
    -   **Decouple the frontend and backend** by creating a separate single-page application (SPA) using a modern framework like **React** or **Vue.js**.
    -   Implement proper security measures, including **CSRF protection** and secure handling of authentication tokens.
-   **AI/ML Module Integration:**
    -   Develop and integrate genuine machine learning models for:
        -   **Predictive expiry management:** Forecast when batches of medicine will expire to reduce waste.
        -   **Inventory optimization:** Predict demand to suggest reorder levels.
-   **Implement a Comprehensive Test Suite:**
    -   Introduce unit tests for backend logic, integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end tests for user workflows.

## 4. Suggested Tech Stack or Tool Upgrades

-   **Backend:** Flask with Blueprints, or a more structured framework like FastAPI.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL.
-   **Blockchain:** Hyperledger Fabric, or a custom PoA implementation.
-   **Frontend:** React or Vue.js.
-   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose to streamline development and deployment.
-   **Testing:** Pytest for backend testing, and a framework like Cypress for end-to-end testing.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

I propose a phased approach to implement these improvements:

### Phase 1: Foundational Refactoring and Database Migration

1.  **Setup Docker:** Containerize the existing application to standardize the development environment.
2.  **Backend Refactoring:** Reorganize the Flask application into Blueprints.
3.  **Database Migration:** Migrate the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL and update the schema.
4.  **Introduce Testing:** Set up a testing framework and write initial tests for critical components.

### Phase 2: Blockchain and Frontend Enhancements

1.  **Blockchain Upgrade:** Replace the current blockchain with a more suitable solution (e.g., a PoA implementation).
2.  **Decouple Frontend:** Develop a separate frontend application with a modern JavaScript framework.
3.  **API Development:** Create a robust REST API on the backend to serve the new frontend.

### Phase 3: AI/ML Integration and Finalization

1.  **Develop AI/ML Models:** Create and train models for expiry prediction and inventory management.
2.  **Integrate Models:** Build API endpoints to serve predictions from the AI/ML models.
3.  **Final Testing and Deployment:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing and prepare for deployment.
