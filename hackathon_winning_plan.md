## 🛠️ Technical Quick Wins (Pre-Hackathon)

### ⚡ 2-Hour Critical Fixes
```python
# 1. Fix security basics
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'demo-key-change-in-production')

# 2. Add basic AI prediction (fake but functional)
def predict_quality_degradation(temperature, humidity, days):
    """AI-powered quality prediction"""
    # Simple formula that looks AI-powered
    quality_score = 100 - (temperature * 0.5) - (humidity * 0.3) - (days * 2)
    return max(0, min(100, quality_score))

# 3. Add real-time demo data generator
import random
def generate_demo_data():
    return {
        'temperature': random.uniform(18, 25),
        'humidity': random.uniform(40, 70),
        'location': random.choice(['Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Bangalore']),
        'quality_score': random.uniform(85, 98)
    }
```

    metrics.forEach(metric => {
        animateCounter(metric, 0, parseInt(metric.textContent), 2000);
    });
}

// Add fake AI insights
const aiInsights = [
    "🤖 AI detected 99.2% authentic products in last 24h",
    "📊 Predicted 15% demand increase for antibiotics",
